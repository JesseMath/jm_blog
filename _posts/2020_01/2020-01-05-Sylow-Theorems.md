figure out how to wrap text. and comment. write about Sylow theorems, extension fields, or Lie groups
First school day of the quarter begins tomorrow. It will begin with my algebra prelim exam at 9:00am.

I have not been preparing as much as I should have over my winter break, but I have been learning about two topics that I believe will be the most helpful for the exam: the Sylow theorems for the group theory section and extension fields for the rings and fields section. This post will be about the former.

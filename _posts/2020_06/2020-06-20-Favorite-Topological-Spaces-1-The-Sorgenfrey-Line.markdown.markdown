# Definition

The Sorgenfrey Line, **E**, is the topological space $$(\mathbb{R}, \tau)$$ where $$\tau$$ is the topology formed by taking as the basic nhoods $$\mathbb{B}_x = \{[x,z):z\in \mathbb{R}\}$$.

The resulting topology, the Sorgenfrey Line **E**, is sometimes also referred to as the "lower limit" topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$.

This is a topology which differs from the usual topology (which has a basis consisting of open intervals of the form $$(a,b)$$):

#### E vs. $$\mathbb{R}$$

One 

### The Sorgenfrey Line behaves a bit differently...

$$E$$ is not second countable whereas $$\mathbb{R}$$ is.

# Properties

### The Sorgenfrey Line is a finer topology than the usual topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$

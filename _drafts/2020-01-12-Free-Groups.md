title: Group Presentations
---

So I am taking group theory this quarter at University of Denver. I have been reviewing the material (mostly to prepare for prelims, but also to look ahead at what I will be learning) and I am excited to begin learning about stuff like the Sylow theorems, the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, series of groups, and all of that stuff (I am particularly excited because we will be using Dummit and Foote as our main textbook -- which is possibly my favorite math book)).

However, one topic that I was not prepared to encounter -- much less in the first class of the quarter --was that of free groups.

So, we haven't actually been introduced to free groups as of yet, but while introducing the dihedral groups, my professor (possibly because he taught universal algebra last quarter, or possibly because this is just how he thinks about group theory) noted that the dihedral group is the "free-ist" group satisfying the classic conditions of $$s^2 = r^n = e = (rs)^n$$. This created a bit of a discussion (mostly between the professor and a single student) about group presentations and "free groups on 2 generators".

Most of this went over my head; however, when I got home I looked into the section on free groups in Dummit and Foote and realized that this section covered a lot of what was discussed.

Since my main motivation for learning this material is due to that initial discussion in class, I have focused mostly on group presentations rather than free groups for this post; though I hope to have another post on free groups in the future (especially if that is a section that we cover in class).

So what is a group presentation?
The definition is

What are some examples?

Why is it useful?

I am a PhD student of mathematics at the University of Denver. The purpose of this blog is to be a place where I can collect all of the interesting things that I am learning about.
While I intend for the content to be mostly math related, I will also post about many other subjects in which I am interested. These interests include physics, neuroscience, computer science, books (fiction and nonfiction), climbing, and running.
